## Auto-generated list of updated pages

{% include random_ad4.html %}

This list is auto-generated based on the last-modified timestamp on pages, scoped to the last 60 days. How does the script work? Every page has a "Last updated" line below the title. This script looks for any pages with a timestamp that appears within the last 60 days.

<table>
<col width="20%">
<col width="80%">
<tr>
<th>Last updated</th>
<th>Page</th>
</tr>

{% assign timeframe = 5184000 %}
{% assign count = 0 %}

{% for post in site.docs %}
  {% assign post_in_seconds = post.last-modified | date: "%s" | plus: 0 %}
  {% assign recent_posts = "now" | date: "%s" | minus: timeframe  %}

  {% if post_in_seconds > recent_posts %}
  {% assign count = count | plus:1 %}

<tr>
<td>{{post.last-modified | date: "%b %d, %Y" }}</td>
<td><a href="{{ post.permalink | prepend: "/learnapidoc" }}">{{ post.title }}</a> </td>
</tr>
{% if count == 15 %}{% break %}{% endif %}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

## Seeing what content has been updated

To see what's been updated on the page, click the GitHub button next to the timestamp on the page:

<img style="max-width: 500px" src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/api/github_button_whats_new.png" alt="GitHub button" />

This takes you to the file in GitHub. In GitHub, click the History link:

## Recent blog posts about API doc site updates

On my blog, I often write announcement-style posts after adding new content on my API course. I tag these with "api-doc" &mdash; you can browse these [API doc site updates here](https://idratherbewriting.com/category-apidoc-site-updates/).
