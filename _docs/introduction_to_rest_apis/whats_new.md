If you're looking to see what's new in the API doc site/course, you can browse new content in several ways.

<h2>Most recent updates</h2>

The following are the most recent updates to the API documentation course.


## June 2023

* Converted the PDF download into separate PDFs of individual chapters rather than a full-length PDF (which was more than 900 pages long). Downloads to the individual chapters are available with each section overview and in the [Download  PDFs](docapis_formats.html) page. 
* Removed the Kindle and ePUB download options, as they weren't popular and the process created more complexity than it was worth.

## October 2022

* Updated the Stoplight tutorial: [Getting started tutorial: Using Stoplight Studio to create an OpenAPI specification document](pubapis_openapis_quickstart_stoplight.html). With many UI and other changes, this tutorial needed a lot of updates. It should now be aligned with the latest Stoplight UI and functionality.

## Recent blog posts about API doc site updates

On my blog, I often write announcement-style posts after adding new content on my API course. I tag these with "api-doc" &mdash; you can browse these [API doc site updates here](https://idratherbewriting.com/category-apidoc-site-updates/).
