The process for managing developer portal documentation includes a number of different tasks outside of content development. The role of a DX (developer experience) content strategist plays a key role in defining workflows, standards, user flows, processes, and other aspects of the site. workflows for different types of documentation. In this section, I cover details for how to manage the doc work, including processes for fixing doc bugs versus tackling larger doc projects. I also explain processes for releasing SDKs, managing external contributions, and more.

A developer portal is a site that not only involves a console where developers retrieve API keys and perform other configuration but where they go to consume documentation for different products. Typically, a developer portal involves a lot of different documentation contributed by many different teams.

For example, a developer portal might contain documentation for 30 or more different products of varying size and importance, with hundreds or thousands of pages. With so much documentation from so many teams, the individual contributor model, with tech writers working in silos and pushing out information, just doesn't work. You basically end up with the equivalent of a wiki dumping ground, where content is a wild west of standards and styles, and where you never know if content is current, outdated, accurate, deprecated, or in process. To avoid this scenario, you need a content steward and manager to define processes, standards, workflows, and other strategies for the content. At this scale, more dedication to tools, processes, high-level strategies, and user workflows needs to be attended to. The following sections describe the role of the content manager.
