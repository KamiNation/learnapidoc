The process for managing developer portal documentation includes a number of different tasks outside of content development. The role of a DX (developer experience) content strategist plays a key role in defining workflows, standards, user flows, processes, and other aspects of the site. workflows for different types of documentation. In this section, I cover details for how to manage the doc work, including processes for fixing doc bugs versus tackling larger doc projects. I also explain processes for releasing SDKs, managing external contributions, and more.
