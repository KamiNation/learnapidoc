In a previous topic, [Sending doc status reports -- a tool for visibility and relationship building](docapis_status_reports.html), I explained how to create and distribute documentation reports. Another tool for accomplishing a similar purpose &mdash; that of making others in your company aware of documentation processes, newly published articles, how to work with your team, etc. &mdash; is to broadcast your meeting notes after each meeting. Although sharing meeting notes with meeting participants after the meeting isn't anything new, with a few small adjustments, it can be powerful.

The basic process of sharing meeting notes hardly needs explanation. It's mostly just a bit time consuming and might put you out of your comfort zone. First, you need to determine which meetings you'll generate notes from. Usually you have some meetings with partner engineers, with other teams publishing in your dev portal, with your own team, or with some teams for high priority projects. Select the meetings where you focus on docs and topics others might care about.

Each meeting should have an associated meeting doc. You or someone else takes notes during the meeting. Hopefully, you have an agenda to prime the meeting's focus and discussion. Afterwards, you type up the meeting notes and send them via email to all relevant groups. The relevant groups are usually broader than the meeting attendees, and that's part of the strategy. That's really all there is to it, though I've expanded on some more aspects of the process below.

## Meeting notes are often more interesting to read

Meeting notes provide a natural story foundation to build around. Usually, meetings involve discussion of issues. Issues are really conflicts. And as all writers know, conflict drives story, and story engages readers. This is why you might find that typing up meeting notes is more fun than writing documentation reports. You can describe real issues you're running up against, strategies to solve the issues, outcomes, and more.

You've got the foundation for interesting content already. Now you can shape and leverage this content to provide other themes and messages that you want to get across.

## What if sensitive topics are discussed during the meeting?

As with any real issues, the matters discussed might be sensitive. If people are complaining about what a pain it is to work with Frank (who wasn't in the meeting), you probably don't want to highlight that in the notes broadcast. You'll have to incorporate some euphemisms around sensitive topics. For example, not "Members said Frank is impossible and should not be leading the publishing tools project," but rather "Members noted some challenges in collaboration in the beta process with the new publishing system."

As you get into a rhythm of sharing meeting notes after the meeting, people might begin to recognize that anything they say might be shared with others outside the meeting. This fear can be a detractor for people opening up during the meeting, so make sure you don't expose anyone in a way that would be inflammatory or embarrassing. For example, don't write, "John said he can't stand working with the ACME engineering team because they never review his docs, so he seems to have deprioritized their project." Again, implement a euphemism or tone it down in other ways. Example: "Some members noted challenges in getting timely doc reviews; getting ignored until the last day before release can be demotivating and create unnecessary crisis situations."

On the flip side, sometimes surfacing issues is a good thing, as it forces the issues into open daylight where some action can be taken. It doesn't make sense to hold everything inside all the time, fuming in silence. One of the purposes of sharing notes is to effect change. If you have an ugly issue to deal with, sometimes writing about it with transparency and honesty is a good approach, even if it ruffles some feathers or induces pain.

## The structure of meeting notes

The meeting notes tend to have the following basic components:

* Meeting title
* Meeting date
* Meeting attendees
* Meeting description
* Meeting topics and discussions
* Action items

In the list of attendees, use company aliases so that others can get more context. If you just list first names (Dave, Sue, Ashwin), others might not know who you're referring to. But if you have aliases listed in the list of attendees, then you can simply refer to people by their first names within the notes.

You might also provide a couple of brief sentences that describe the purpose of the meeting. Write this from the mindset that others who don't know your team, who you are or what you do, etc., will be reading it.

## How long should the meeting notes be?

Remember that others will lack the context of those in the meeting. Even those in the meeting might not have been fully following the discussion and details. Take the time to fill in the blanks. This might mean the meeting notes consist of longer, more narrative summaries. Make the content skimmable with lots of subheadings and short paragraphs. As a tech writer, you know how to structure content so that it's readable. I prefer a subheading for every 1-2 paragraphs of content.

Sometimes people provide stenographic-like notes of a meeting, noting what everyone said in a play-by-play fashion. Avoid this approach and instead prefer more concise summaries of the issues and discussion. Seriously, make it readable. Otherwise, what's the point?

## How do you find the time for this?

If you grabbed time from half a dozen peoples' calendars, you can probably spend 30 minutes post-meeting doing the writeup by yourself. If you're busy, you can postpone the task 1-2 days later. The writeup doesn't need to be a masterpiece, but you'll probably polish and refine the content more than a non-writer would. Just don't obsess. Keep it simple and recognize that meeting notes reflect the discussion of the meeting, and that meeting might have been somewhat disjointed and scatterbrained, touching a lot of different topics and points. A writeup that reflects the meeting might need a bit of re-organization and artificial structure to be readable.

Also recognize that the first few writeups are the most time-consuming (as with any activity). Once you get into a rhythm and style, the writeup becomes fairly easy. It's also a great way to take a closer examination of the meeting and make sure you've accounted for all action items and other loose ends. The writeup reinforces that you take the meeting seriously, and that it's worth everyone's time to attend. Overall, strike a balance between context and concision that makes sense time-wise. Expect that readers will likely glance through the notes and see if anything merits a closer read.

## How do you decide on who to include in the broadcast?

This is where broadcasting meeting notes becomes strategic. Who you include is how you "manage up," as they say. For example, suppose you have a channel where many groups post their meeting notes and the business stakeholders read them to stay updated across these groups. This means you'll have some readers who are 2-3 levels above your team. What do you want them to know about your team? About documentation? Raise issues and help them get a better sense of your challenges, successes, and other matters.

For example, suppose you faced challenges in figuring out the context for a new documentation topic. Maybe the documentation covers a new API that doesn't fit into any specific product's docs. This product ambiguity is causing confusion in the organization of docs. Maybe a senior leader can share some insights that help clarify the product direction and fit with other content. And if a senior leader starts chiming in with insights, they'll suddenly become aware of the docs, what they contain, and that you've been working on components relevant to the user experience for the API.

Besides influencing up, you can also include parallel teams (especially those outside your immediate organization) to influence across. Other writer groups might have more insight about processes and techniques that could help you with the issues you face. It's likely that the challenges your group encounters are similar to issues other writer groups have faced (and maybe solved). Others might have been around much longer and have solutions, so loop them in if appropriate.


## How can you leverage post-meeting participation from non-meeting participants?

Ideally, you want to allow those who didn't attend the meeting to add their thoughts. This is how sharing meeting notes can create a boomerang of information coming back to you and allow you to leverage the wisdom of others. If you keep your meeting notes in Google Docs or other documents that others can comment on, it makes it easy for them to jump in with some comments. Add a short note in the email that invites others to comment on the issues, explicitly inviting them to participate. Sometimes those who didn't attend might feel they shouldn't "butt in" to comment on a meeting they weren't a part of, but if you make the invite to participate more explicit, they might be more inclined.

## Are there downsides to sharing issues, frustrations, or problems with others? Won't that make us look bad/incompetent?

You might think that sharing issues, frustrations, or problems you're running into isn't a strategic way to communicate your expertise at authoring and publishing. Suppose you have a laundry list of technical challenges, behavioral hurdles, and organizational culture issues that you're dealing with. It can be hard to be transparent about these issues and to share them with others. We often want to communicate a facade of expertise.

However, I've learned that as a blogger, readers value transparency. We like to see what issues others are facing and how they're approaching those issues. Reading a blog of someone who always knows how to handle every situation, who always knows the right answers for every situation, etc., isn't a very interesting read. Dare to be human. That humanity endears readers to your side. In this light, think of your meeting notes almost as a sort of blog entry, detailing your forays against your enemies (that enemy might be processes, technologies, etc.).

## What do you do with all of this visibility?

One consequence of sharing your meeting notes is that you become visible. It takes guts to share a meeting writeup with 50 people. Do that repeatedly, and pretty soon they come to know you. This is what happened with my blog, idratherbewriting.com. It's rare that I go to any tech comm event without running into people who know me (even if I don't know them). Blogging has made me super visible. Is visibility a good thing? Why would you want to be visible, and what do you do with that visibility?

Visibility for the sake of visibility alone is vanity. Almost no introverted writer wants to be this visible, with everyone carefully seeing your every move and thought. I never wanted to be a "famous" technical writer, if such a description is warranted. However, with visibility comes _influence_. Your visibility gives you a platform to influence others in ways that those without the platform lack. This is why NBA players often talk about issues outside of basketball &mdash; because they recognize that their visibility gives them more influence with people. Their spotlight on national television gives them a platform that many have used to highlight racial injustices.

What will you use your influence for? You've earned the influence through your hard work, writing up meeting notes and daring to share them with broad groups. At some point, you'll need to recognize that you've become an influencer and ponder what that means.

In the context of tech comm in a company, consider using your influence to move forward your strategic initiatives and other plans. That's the larger game. What do you want to make happen? Do you want leadership to increase the number of tech writers on your team? Do you want engineers to give you a seat at the API design table? Do you want engineers to treat the doc review process with more seriousness? Do you want project teams to start doing more of their own writing? Do you want your colleagues to follow the style guide? Do you want to be looped in earlier about upcoming projects? Think about your larger strategies and consider occasionally bringing up those themes in your notes. As you think about influence, typing up your meeting notes becomes more than just a secretarial task. This becomes a content opportunity, with a user audience and potential calls to action.
