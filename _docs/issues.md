To track issues and updates to the site, I'm using the [Issues log in GitHub](https://github.com/tomjoht/learnapidoc/issues).

{% include course_image.html url="https://github.com/tomjoht/learnapidoc/issues" size="medium" filename="githubissueslog" ext_print="png" ext_web="png" border="true" alt="Log an issue in GitHub" caption="Log an issue in GitHub" %}

Issues can include any of the following:

* Site errors
* Typos or style issues
* Incorrect content
* Missing content
* Outdated content
* Suggested enhancements

You can also [contact me](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/contact.html){: .noCrossRef} with issues, requests, or other feedback.
