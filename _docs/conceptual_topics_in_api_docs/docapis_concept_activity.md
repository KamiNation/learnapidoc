With each of the conceptual topics in this section, you've been analyzing the topic in the context of the [open-source project you identified](docapis_find_open_source_project.html).

{% include random_ad4.html %}

Now broaden your analysis to see how these conceptual topics appear in other API documentation sites.

{% include random_ad1.html %}

{% include image_ad_right.html %}

Remember that sometimes the best way to learn how to create API documentation is to carefully observe how it's done on sites you admire. Following standard practices in the industry helps you create more predictable, easy-to-follow patterns in your own documentation.
