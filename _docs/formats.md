You can read this content in two alternative formats:

* <i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> [PDF](https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/learnapidoc-outputs/docapis.pdf) (last-generated: {{page.last-modified}}). 919 pages
* <i class="fa fa-book" aria-hidden="true"></i> [Kindle](https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/learnapidoc-outputs/docapis.mobi) (last-generated: {{page.last-modified}}) 256 MB
* <i class="fa fa-file-text" aria-hidden="true"></i> [EPUB](https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/learnapidoc-outputs/docapis.epub) (last-generated: {{page.last-modified}}) 47 MB

I periodically regenerate these formats, so the content should more or less be the same across web, PDF, Kindle, and EPUB.

## PDF

To read the content as PDF, it's recommended that you either read the PDF in [Adobe Acrobat Reader DC](https://get.adobe.com/reader/) (or similar) so that you can highlight and annotate the content, or that you print only specific sections at a time, defining the page ranges. Otherwise, this 900+ page PDF will consume an entire tree.

## Kindle

To read the content on Kindle device:

1.  Click the Kindle file above. When you do, the MOBI file downloads to your computer.
2.  Connect your Kindle device to your computer with a USB cord. Your Kindle device will indicate that it's in USB Drive Mode.
3.  In Finder (Mac) or Explorer (Windows), look for a new Kindle drive to appear, and open it.
4.  Drag the `docapis.mobi` file into the `Documents` folder.
5.  Disconnect the USB cord (on a Mac, eject the Kindle drive first). Then look at the list of books in "Your Library." You will see "Documenting REST APIs" as a title.

    On your Kindle, click Contents button on the Kindle nav bar to browse through the sections at any time.

You can also read the content on a Kindle viewer on your computer. The content added to your physical device automatically sync with the computer app.

Note that although Kindle switched to primarily preferring EPUB, it still supports MOBI, and the MOBI file has a better table of contents from the "Go to" button.

## EPUB

For other e-readers that require EPUB format, download the EPUB file above.

## Other formats

If you need the content in another format, download the MOBI file and then convert it to a plethora of other formats through [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/).
