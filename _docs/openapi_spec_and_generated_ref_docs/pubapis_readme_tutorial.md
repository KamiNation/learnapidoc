General strategy:

Create a tutorial similar to this one with Stoplight: https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/pubapis_openapis_quickstart_stoplight.html

To fit into the theme of this section, this tutorial should show how to create an OpenAPI specification document using Readme.com. The course uses the OpenWeatherMap API as a sample API, specifically this Current weather data endpoint here: https://openweathermap.org/current. I know you can create a lot of other developer content in Readme.com, but this section focuses on REST API reference only.

The tutorial should show how Readme.com can be used to create an OpenAPI spec document such as this: https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/docs/rest_api_specifications/openapi_openweathermap.yml.

And also a demo on the UX for the experience, such as this: https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/pubapis_stoplight_demo.html

Some expectations: For images, you can either host them on your own server or you can share them with me, and I'll upload them to my server. I don't store images in GitHub. As you release new versions of Readme.com, it would be great if you could keep this tutorial up to date.

Suggested sections:

## Tutorial objectives
- show how Readme.com can be used to produce OpenAPI spec
- show general process of using form-based authoring to generate out spec
- demonstrate UX of Readme.com with OpenAPI info

## Why use Readme.com
- pros and cons
- more integrated doc experience
- Try it out features
- doesn't require knowledge of OpenAPI spec format

## Requirements
- trial versus paid plan
- types of APIs supported
- approximate time involved
- expertise requirements

## Create a project in Readme.com
- how do you get started
- initial setup steps
- general space/editor/tool where you work with the API

Other sections:
- Entering general API information
- Entering parameters
- Entering sample requests
- Entering responses, etc.

## Previewing the output
- how to see what it looks like
- testing out the Try it out experience

## Publishing your project
- how do you make the project live
- how do you export the OpenAPI spec

## Demo the output
- here can you just link to the Demos topic: pubapis_readme_demo.html
