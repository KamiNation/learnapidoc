  weight: 1
  row: 21

- title: Reference material is interactive
  description: "The docs allow users to interact with the functions, API calls, or other commands often using their custom data. Typically, with REST APIs, an API explorer allows users to try out requests using their own data. Other sites might use Jupyter Notebooks to run code that can be customized. Seeing responses with your own data can make the API seem more relevant."
  weight: 1
  row: 22

- title: Feedback options available
  description: "A feedback option is included in the docs so readers can relay feedback about their experience. When users provide feedback, they get the sense that someone is listening. This helps users feel more relevant."

  row: 29

- title: Subsystems have their own overview pages
  description: "For larger systems that might have multiple subsystems (e.g., groups of APIs for different scenarios), these subsystems have their own landing pages that resemble the higher-level overview (with use cases, diagrams, getting started links) but scoped to that specific subsystem."
  weight: 1
  row: 30

- title: Access and authorization explained

  row: 33

- title: README file exists in code repo
  description: "If the product has a code repository, the repository contains a README file that provides information similar to the overview (but abbreviated), including information on how to contribute if applicable. (The README might simply link to the documentation overview but also include unique sections such as how to contribute in the repo.)"
  weight: 1
  row: 34

- title: Tasks have prerequisites sections
  description: "Each task has a \"Prerequisites\" section that explains knowledge requirements, tool requirements, essential concepts, etc., necessary for completing the task."
  weight: 2
  row: 35

- title: Tasks have numbered steps or sections
  description: "Tasks are articulated through a series of specific, usually numbered steps or sections that reduce the complexity of the task. More complex tasks might require more granular and numerous steps or sections so as to reduce the complexity. (This is the primary way that technical writers simplify complexity.)"
  weight: 2
  row: 36

- title: Sample app available
  description: "In more robust docs, a <a href='docapis_sample_apps.html'>sample app</a> might serve as a reference implementation for users."

  weight: 2
  row: 38

completeness:

- title: Reference docs follow industry standards
  description: "For native library APIs (or other API types), reference docs (auto-generated from source code comments) are available. This might mean <a href='nativelibraryapis_exploring_javadoc_output.html'>Javadoc</a>, <a href='nativelibraryapis_doxygen.html'>Doxygen</a>, <a href='pubapis_openapi_intro.html'>OpenAPI</a> outputs like <a href='pubapis_swagger.html'>Swagger</a> or other reference docs specific to the library. The reference docs should be populated and generally follow tagging standards."
  weight: 3
  row: 41

- title: Reference content has consistent structure
  description: "Reference material such as APIs follow a <a href='docapis_api_reference_tutorial_overview.html'>common structure within each topic</a>, mostly following a request-response type structure. Typical sections include descriptions, parameters, sample requests or usage, and sample responses."
  weight: 3

  weight: 2
  row: 45

- title: Troubleshooting section exists
  description: "The documentation has a troubleshooting section (either standalone or included within the section/topic it relates to) that provides information on how to solve common problems. The troubleshooting information indicates where things might go wrong and how to fix them. In other words, the documentation doesn't just describe the happy path."
  weight: 2
  row: 46

- title: Limitations/thresholds documented
  description: "If there are <a href='docapis_rate_limiting_and_thresholds.html'>limitations and thresholds</a> (for example, max number of API calls, max file sizes, max string lengths, max/min parameter values, max server load), these limitations are called out in the docs."
  weight: 2
  row: 47

- title: Locale limitations noted
  description: "If a feature is available only in certain contexts (locales, languages,  platforms, roles, versions), that information is noted clearly in the feature. For example, an API that is only available for enterprise versions might have a label that says \"Enterprise Version Only,\" or if only available for a particular platform, might say \"Linux Only\" or the equivalent."
  weight: 2
  row: 48

readability:

- title: Sidebar nav has consumable organization at a glance
  description: "The sidebar navigation lets users take in a sense of the whole while also allowing users to expand more details as desired. The sidebar isn't a massive list of seemingly endless scrolling and expansion + expansion + expansion but divides up doc sets into logical groups, like chapters in a book. For systems with large numbers of topics, progressive disclose techniques might be implemented across primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of information."
  weight: 1
  row: 51

- title: Sidebar nav highlights current topic
  description: "As the user navigates each topic, the sidebar navigation makes it clear where the user is in the navigation (for example, the topic highlights clearly and the navigation sticks open at that level). Breadcrumbs might also help establish site context."
  weight: 2
  row: 52

- title: Context remains consistent when navigating
  description: "When a user clicks topics in the navigation, the UI doesn't shift context in jarring ways, such as unexpectedly taking the user to another doc set or changing stable navigation areas like the sidebar and header (which are usually consistent for every page). This jarring navigation often happens when sidebar entries point to topics in other doc sites. If this is the case, the external links have an icon indicating the link takes them to another site."
  weight: 1
  row: 53

- title: Doc types have consistent names across product docs
  description: "Common topics have similar names across doc sets in the developer portal. For example, the Overview, Getting Started, Troubleshooting, Glossary, Release Notes, and Reference are named consistently to help users understand how to navigate the site. One doc set shouldn't call a topic \"Latest updates\" and \"First steps\" while another uses \"What's new\" and \"Quickstart.\""
  weight: 1
  row: 54

- title: Subheadings are descriptive
  description: "The subheadings are descriptive enough to allow users to get a gist of the topic by merely reading the subheadings. The subheadings also follow a parallel structure so they can be more easily scanned and read."
  weight: 1
  row: 55

- title: Topics start with summaries
  description: "Each topic usually has a <a href='https://idratherbewriting.com/2018/09/15/pages-at-a-glance-feature/#enforcing-best-practices-with-structure'>short summary below the title</a> that encapsulates the main purpose of the topic. This helps users get a sense of the topic at a glance."
  weight: 1
  row: 56

- title: Glossary exists
  description: "Unfamiliar words and jargon are defined in a <a href='docapis_glossary_section.html'>glossary</a>. At times, the glossary terms are linked to their glossary definitions."
  weight: 1
  row: 57

- title: Code samples have proper formatting and highlighting
  description: "The formatting in code samples follows standard white spacing, line breaks, and other syntax for the language. Code syntax highlighting appropriate to the language has been applied to increase the code's readability."
  weight: 1
  row: 58

- title: Responsive view presents content in readable way
  description: "The content can be read on a mobile device (e.g., iPhone) in a usable way. For example, the responsive view allows users to navigate the sidebar links and view code samples."
  weight: 1
  row: 59
